# 3333_proj2: Expression Trees

This project is about designing and implementing expression trees, which are special cases of parse trees or grammar trees, this implemntation does the following.
    *   Gets a binary arithmetic expression as input from a given input file, build a binary expression tree for the input expressions, one per line. You must not change the format or content of the input file.
   *   Checks whether there are any synctactic or semantic errors in the expressions. If yes, then report the erros.
   *   If there are no erros in the input expression, then
          *  The value of the input expression will be calculated and displayed.
          *  Print the infic, prefic, and postifx expressions of the input expression.
  *  In addition to binary arithmetic expressions, I added binary relation operators of       <, <=, ==, !=, >, >=, and logical operators of ||, &&, and !.
